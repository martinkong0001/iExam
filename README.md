# iExam
iExam is an Android app which helps users easily benchmark their eyesights by taking a virtual eye exam.\

# Motivation
The motivation behind this app is that many online vision tests are very cumbersome and inconvenient,\
most of them require the use of a laptop and measuring distance by hand.\
In this app, augmented reality and voice recognition allow for a streamlined process.\

# Features
The Snellen eye chart is simulated in augmented reality, with the help from Google's ARCore API.\
The eye chart will be automatically placed in the correct position,\
so that users do not need to worry about measuring distance by hand.\
Furthermore, voice recognition is implemented using Android's Speech-to-Text API to process user input.\
This way, users do not have to manually type each letter down,\
as it is quite tiresome to type answers and hold the phone upright at the same time.\
